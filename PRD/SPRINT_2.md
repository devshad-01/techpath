# Sprint 2 — User Experience: Web Profile Wizard & Results Dashboard

## Goal

Build the full user-facing web interface served by SWI-Prolog: a landing page, a multi-step profile wizard (Interests → Skills → Personality → Review), a results dashboard showing ranked career recommendations with confidence scores and explanations, and career detail pages. All HTML is generated by Prolog's `html_write` library and styled with DaisyUI via CDN.

## Prerequisites

Sprint 1 must be complete. The Prolog server at `http://localhost:5000` must be running with all JSON API endpoints functional.

## Step-by-step Requirements

### 1. HTML Template System (`templates.pl`)

Build a reusable `page_layout/3` predicate using `html_write` that wraps every page in:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` with proper meta tags and viewport.
- DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN in `<head>`.
- A DaisyUI `navbar` component with "TechPath Advisor" branding and navigation links (Home, About).
- A `<main>` content area.
- A `<footer>` with credit text.
- Custom CSS from `/static/css/custom.css`.

### 2. Landing Page (`/`)

Serve an engaging landing page with:

- **Hero Section:** Bold headline "Discover Your Ideal Tech Career", subheadline, and a DaisyUI `btn btn-primary` CTA: "Start Your Assessment →" linking to `/wizard`.
- **How It Works:** Three DaisyUI `card` components: "Tell us your interests", "Share your skills", "Get personalized recommendations".
- **Stats Section:** "15+ Career Paths", "40+ Attributes Analyzed", "Powered by Expert System AI" using DaisyUI `stats` component.

### 3. Profile Wizard (`/wizard`)

Serve a multi-step wizard page. Use DaisyUI `steps` component for progress indication. Client-side JavaScript (`wizard.js`) handles step navigation and attribute selection without full page reloads.

**Step 1 — Interests:** Fetch interests from `/api/attributes/interest`. Display as selectable DaisyUI `card` components in a grid. Toggle selection on click.

**Step 2 — Skills:** Fetch skills from `/api/attributes/skill`. Display as DaisyUI `badge` chips in a flex-wrap layout with a search filter input. Toggle on click.

**Step 3 — Personality:** Fetch personality traits from `/api/attributes/personality`. Display as larger descriptive DaisyUI cards. Toggle on click.

**Step 4 — Review & Submit:** Summary of all selections as removable DaisyUI `badge` chips grouped by type. "Get My Recommendations" button that POSTs to `/api/analyze` and redirects to `/results`.

Validation: at least 1 selection per step required before proceeding.

### 4. Results Dashboard (`/results`)

Serve a results page (or render client-side from API response):

- **Top 3** career matches as prominent DaisyUI `card` components with: rank badge, career title, confidence percentage, DaisyUI `radial-progress` or `progress` bar (color-coded), explanation text, matched attributes as colored `badge` chips, and "View Details →" link.
- **Remaining results** as a DaisyUI `table` with rank, title, confidence mini-bar, and "View Details" link.
- "Retake Assessment" button.

### 5. Career Detail Page (`/career/Id`)

- Career title, full description, metadata displayed in a DaisyUI `stats` grid.
- All required attributes grouped by type with weights shown as DaisyUI `progress` bars.
- If user context exists, highlight matched vs. missing attributes with suggestions.

### 6. Responsive Design

- Mobile-first: all layouts must work at 375px width.
- Use DaisyUI responsive utilities and Tailwind breakpoints.
- Semantic HTML with `aria-label` attributes on interactive elements.

### 7. Error & Loading States

- DaisyUI `loading` spinner during API calls.
- DaisyUI `alert alert-error` for network failures.
- Graceful empty states if no results returned.
